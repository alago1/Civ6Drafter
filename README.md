# Civilization 6 Visual Drafter

A small project made before a game with friends.

Website: [Civ 6 Drafter](www.civ6-drafter.herokuapp.com).

Shows all 20 vanilla nations from Civilization 6 and lets you peek into some of their characteristics.
You can ban or select nations before the draft.

Selected Nations have predetermined players.
For instance if you want the new player to have an easier character to pick up.

Banned and excluded characters are excluded from the draft.
